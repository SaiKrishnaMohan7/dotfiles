# dotfiles
My dotfiles repo

## TODOs

- [ ] .yabairc
- [ ] .skhdrc
- [ ] /the zshrc loader should have a ignore files array to ignore scripts that are of no use
- [ ] p10k has special fonts, nerd fonts I think, there has to be a mac way of automating that too
- [ ] I think yadm handles symlinks, this needs to be tested. From the look of it does seem like it handles symlinks

## Why this?

Maintaining the same devex across all the machines at my disposal helps me to be productive and get up and running faster
