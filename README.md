# dotfiles
My dotfiles repo. This repo is to be used with [ansible_automation](github.com/saikrishnamohan7/ansible_automation)

## Tools being used

- [YADM](https://yadm.io/)
- 1password, ssh agent and cli (can be installed via homebrew) for secrets management
- Ansible [NOT YET]

## Why this?

Maintaining the same devex across all the machines at my disposal helps me to be productive and get up and running faster
