# dotfiles
My dotfiles repo

## TODOs

- [ ] Figure out a better way to save and sync vscode/cursor settings
- [ ] Kube config and kube plugins stuff

## Tools being used

- [YADM](https://yadm.io/)
- 1password, ssh agent and cli (can be installed via homebrew) for secrets management
- Ansible [NOT YET]

## Why this?

Maintaining the same devex across all the machines at my disposal helps me to be productive and get up and running faster
