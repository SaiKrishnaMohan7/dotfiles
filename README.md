# dotfiles
My dotfiles repo

## TODOs

- [ ] .yabairc
- [ ] .skhdrc
- [x] /the zshrc loader should have a ignore files array to ignore scripts that are of no use
  - Chose to go with include file style
- [x] p10k has special fonts, nerd fonts I think, there has to be a mac way of automating that too
  - Chose to go with setting up anew each time; installation will be automated. p10k configure will bw run again which will generate a new p10k zsh file; in iterm the font installation is also handled so no use in pulling old p10k.zsh
- [x] I think yadm handles symlinks, this needs to be tested. From the look of it does seem like it handles symlinks
  - yadm does more of a bare repo action
- [ ] Kube config and kube plugins stuff

## Why this?

Maintaining the same devex across all the machines at my disposal helps me to be productive and get up and running faster
