## Steps post setting this up

- When setting up personal and work git on the same machine and the host is same, github.com, then after moving the contents of the .ssh dir, set the origin for fetch and pull to `git remote set-url github-personal:SaiKrishnaMohan7/Playground.git`
- Same for the work account
